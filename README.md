## ðŸ“– About Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It simulates cellular automaton on a grid where cells live or die based on simple rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation)
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on (survival)
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation)
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction)

These simple rules lead to fascinating patterns and behaviors, making it a classic example of emergent complexity.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Responsive Grid**: Automatically adapts to any screen size while maintaining square cells
- **Interactive Controls**: 
  - Start/Stop the simulation
  - Reset the grid to a blank state
  - Generate random patterns
  - Adjust simulation speed
- **Cell Interaction**: Click to toggle cells or drag to draw alive cells
- **Cell States**: 
  - White: Never lived
  - Blue: Alive
  - Green: Dead (previously alive)
- **Generation Counter**: Tracks the number of simulation steps

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

This project is built using:

- **HTML5**: For structure
